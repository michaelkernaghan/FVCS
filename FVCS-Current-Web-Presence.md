# Fraser Valley Croquet Society - Current Web Presence Analysis

**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Purpose:** Document existing online presence prior to building dedicated FVCS website

---

## Executive Summary

The Fraser Valley Croquet Society (FVCS) currently has minimal direct web presence. Its primary visibility comes through:
1. The Abbotsford Croquet Club website (which operates under FVCS)
2. A Facebook group
3. Listing on Croquet Canada's affiliated clubs page (as "Abbotsford Lawn Bowling and Croquet Club")

**Key Finding:** FVCS lacks a dedicated website to establish its identity as a distinct regional society separate from its member club (Abbotsford).

**FVCS References:**
- Listed in schema.org structured data as parent organization
- Referenced on Resources page
- Meta description mentions "Fraser Valley sports"

**Relationship:** The website primarily presents itself as "Abbotsford Croquet Club" with FVCS mentioned as background organizational structure rather than as the regional umbrella society it actually is.

### 2.2 Facebook Presence
**Group URL:** https://www.facebook.com/groups/675752440081704/

**Status:** Group exists and is referenced on Abbotsford Croquet Club website

**Limitations:**
- Facebook groups are limited for official organizational communications

## 4. Gap Analysis: What's Missing

### 4.1 No Dedicated FVCS Website
**Problem:** FVCS lacks independent web presence to:
- Establish identity as regional umbrella society
- Demonstrate viability as registered BC Society
- Serve as reference for critical society information
- Support public outreach and recruitment
- Facilitate municipal partnerships (Mission rec course application)
- Clearly distinguish FVCS from member club (Abbotsford)

### 4.2 Unclear Organizational Hierarchy
**Problem:** Current web presence conflates:
- Fraser Valley Croquet Society (regional society)
- Abbotsford Croquet Club (member club)
- Abbotsford Lawn Bowling Club (facility host)

### 4.3 Limited Discoverability
**Problem:**
- No dedicated domain (e.g., fraservalleycroquet.ca)
- Not indexed under "Fraser Valley Croquet Society" in searches
- Facebook group requires login to view
- Croquet Canada listing uses club name, not society name

### 4.4 Insufficient Municipal/Institutional Presence
**Problem:** For applications to municipalities (Mission recreation course) and potential partnerships:
- No dedicated webpage to reference
- Cannot demonstrate organizational structure
- Cannot showcase programs, governance, or regional scope

## 7. Recommendations for New FVCS Website

### Primary Goals
1. **Establish distinct identity** separate from Abbotsford club
2. **Demonstrate viability** as registered BC Society
3. **Provide reference** for critical society information
4. **Support public outreach** and member recruitment
5. **Facilitate partnerships** with municipalities and Croquet Canada

### Essential Content
- Society registration information (S0075824)
- Organizational structure and governance
- Member clubs/programs (Abbotsford, Mission course, etc.)
- Membership information and how clubs can join
- Contact information and leadership
- Connection to Croquet Canada
- News and updates
- Resources for new players and clubs

### Technical Considerations
- Distinct domain (fraservalleycroquet.ca recommended)
- Clear differentiation from abbotsfordcroquet.com
- Professional, institutional appearance
- SEO optimized for "Fraser Valley Croquet Society"
- Links to member clubs but maintains independent identity
- Proper schema.org markup showing organizational hierarchy

### Integration with Existing Assets
- Link to/from Abbotsford Croquet Club site
- Reference Facebook group as community space
- Coordinate with Croquet Canada listing update
- Support Mission recreation course application

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Secure domain:** fraservalleycroquet.ca
2. **Design FVCS website** with distinct identity
3. **Update Croquet Canada listing** to reflect Fraser Valley Croquet Society as member (rather than just Abbotsford club)
4. **Cross-link** between FVCS and Abbotsford sites with clear hierarchy
5. **Optimize SEO** to establish "Fraser Valley Croquet Society" as searchable entity
6. **Create content** demonstrating society viability and regional scope

---

## Conclusion

Fraser Valley Croquet Society currently lacks the web presence necessary to function effectively as a regional umbrella organization. The new dedicated website will:
- Establish FVCS as distinct from its member club (Abbotsford)
- Provide credibility for municipal partnerships and grant applications
- Support growth strategy (Mission course, additional clubs)
- Create proper organizational hierarchy visible to public and Croquet Canada
- Serve as central reference for society information and governance

The website will work in concert with, but remain distinct from, the Abbotsford Croquet Club website, clearly demonstrating the regional scope and organizational structure of FVCS.
